# Issues

Lightweight backlog `define-next` can prioritize. Append entries; `review` deletes resolved ones.

**Format** — one entry per issue:

```
## <short title>
- **Priority:** critical | normal | low
- **Source:** [human] | [review] | [advance]
- **What / where / how to verify:** <the problem, its location, and the check that proves it fixed>
- **Spec:** <optional — target.md or an ADR section this is rooted in>
```

**Priority semantics:** `critical` preempts everything; `normal` is weighed against the state→target
gap; **`low` is skipped by the loop** (reserved for human-directed work). The `Source` tag records who
filed it and does **not** affect priority.
