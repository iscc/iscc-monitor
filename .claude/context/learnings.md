# Learnings

High-signal pitfalls, patterns, and verified conventions accumulated by the `review` role. Keep each
entry specific and actionable. The entries below are **seeded from the build plan's "Correctness
rules"** — the load-bearing gotchas — so the loop knows them from iteration 1.

## Correctness rules (seeded from `.claude/plans/cosmic-baking-octopus.md`)

- **Origin = `<domain>/log`**, never the bare domain. Used for the signed-note `name` and the
  verifier key. One `origin()` helper, golden-tested against both live hubs. (Highest-probability bug.)
- **`iscc_id → seq` is one-to-many, and verification is schema-agnostic (ADR-0008).** Index by `seq`;
  store the raw `note.$schema`; lookups return a list. Unknown schemas are indexed + proof-able but
  never interpreted and never gate checkpoint acceptance.
- **Partial-tile discipline (ADR-0005).** Mark a tile/bundle BLOB `is_full` (immutable) only at
  `width == 256`; re-fetch partials (`.p/<W>`) every poll and overwrite. Never promote a partial.
- **A self-consistency violation freezes, never crashes (ADR-0006).** Three triggers —
  fork / shrink / equivocation. Persist both raw checkpoints + proof permanently, set `frozen=1`,
  alert once, keep polling evidence-only at a backed-off cadence, no auto-unfreeze, survive restart,
  other hubs unaffected.
- **Coverage honesty (ADR-0001).** Record `monitored_since`; state guarantees *from coverage start*.
  A late start backfills tiles for full data + forward guarantees but cannot retroactively detect
  pre-coverage equivocation.
- **SQLite single writer per DB (ADR-0005/0007).** WAL + `busy_timeout`; one goroutine owns all
  writes per network file; network fetch happens *outside* the write transaction.
- **OTS never blocks** the follower loop; calendars are best-effort with backoff + redundancy.
- **did:web is the only key source (ADR-0009).** Resolution failure → `unresolvable` (keep
  mirroring). A signature matching no listed key → `unverified`. Domain-compromise is out of scope.
- **`proof/verify` is pure** (no `net`/`os`/`sqlite` imports) — it is shared by the server,
  `verify-for-me`, and the WASM build. Keep it import-clean or the WASM build breaks.

## Go / tooling conventions

- `CGO_ENABLED=0` everywhere → **do not use `go test -race`** (the race detector needs cgo) and do
  not pull cgo-dependent deps. `modernc.org/sqlite` is the pure-Go SQLite driver for this reason.
- Port from `cauldron/` reference copies; never `import` them (they are gitignored, not a module dep).
- **`cauldron/` breaks a fresh `go build ./...`**: its reference trees need external deps the root
  module lacks. The local fix is gitignored stub `go.mod` files at `cauldron/iscc-hub/` +
  `cauldron/tessera/` (separate modules → Go skips them). These are NOT committed, so any CI running
  `go build ./...` on a fresh checkout that includes `cauldron/` will hit the same failure — CI must
  either not check out `cauldron/`, add the same stubs, or use a `go.work` exclude. (Verified: entire
  `cauldron/` is `.gitignore`d, so it never reaches CI from this repo's tree anyway.)
- **Verifier-key golden test is the trust-root oracle gate.** `internal/didweb` derivation matches
  `.claude/derive_vkey.py` byte-for-byte (keyid = BE-uint32 of `SHA-256(name||0x0A||0x01||pub)[:4]`,
  base64 **Std** padded). Go added a defensive `len(raw) < 34` check before the multicodec assert —
  the Python port would index-panic on a short key instead. Keep this guard when porting crypto.
- **Oracle parity is reproducible and external, not self-referential.** Reviewer can re-run
  `python3 .claude/derive_vkey.py` (Python 3.11 present, no deps) → both golden vectors print exactly
  (`sb0…+40b74463+…`, `sb1…+22b08f3e+…`), and the testdata `publicKeyMultibase` values equal the
  oracle's `HUBS` map. Side effect: the oracle writes `.claude/.scratch/` (NOT gitignored) — `rm -rf`
  it after running so it doesn't dirty the tree.
- **`internal/didweb` purity nuance:** `go list -deps` shows `os` in the closure even for a pure
  parser, because `fmt` transitively imports `os`. That is stdlib and unavoidable; the load-bearing
  rule (no `net`/`net/http`/`database/sql`, WASM-shareable) holds — verify with
  `GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build ./internal/didweb`, not by grepping `os` out of the dep list.
- **did:web `assertionMethod` is polymorphic** — an entry is either a JSON string (`#fragment` DID-URL
  ref into `verificationMethod`) or an inline object. The clean decode is `[]json.RawMessage` then
  try-string-first (a JSON object fails to unmarshal into a Go `string`, so it falls through to the
  inline path unambiguously). Live testnet docs use the string-ref form.
- **`DocumentURL` W3C did:web mapping is implemented + golden-tested** (`internal/didweb/url.go`): MSID
  is colon-split, each segment `url.PathUnescape`d, first segment = `host[:port]`, rest = path; no path
  → `/.well-known/did.json`, path → `/<segs>/did.json`. Live hubs (no path/port) hit `.well-known`.
  Errors on missing `did:web:` prefix, empty MSID, empty host, bad percent-encoding. `net/url` is the
  URL-parsing half only — it does **not** pull `net`/`net/http` into the closure, so WASM build stays
  green (verified). When the follower lands, it owns the actual fetch; `DocumentURL` stays pure.
- **Export surface for the follower seam is now `DocumentURL` + `ParseDIDDocument` + `VerifierKey`**
  (in `internal/didweb`). `pubkeyFromDID`/`keyID`/`b58decode` deliberately stay package-private — the
  follower derives keys via the three exported entrypoints only. Mechanical renames did not move the
  derived bytes (oracle parity reconfirmed).
