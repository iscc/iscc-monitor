# Configure Codex CLI for devcontainer use.
#
# Codex stores its state in SQLite databases under CODEX_HOME (~/.codex), opened
# in WAL mode. WAL needs a shared-memory (-shm) file accessed via mmap + POSIX
# locking, which a Windows->container bind mount (Docker Desktop gRPC-FUSE/
# virtiofs) does not support — codex then fails with "disk I/O error"
# (SQLITE_IOERR_SHMOPEN, code 4618). Sharing the bind mount also lets the host
# and container codex builds collide on migration checksums ("migration 1 was
# previously applied but has been modified"). So ~/.codex lives on a native
# Docker volume (real ext4 -> WAL works, isolated from the host -> no migration
# clash) and the host's ~/.codex is bind-mounted read-only at ~/.codex-host.
# This script seeds the volume from the host config on first create so the host
# ChatGPT login carries over, without putting SQLite on the bind mount.
#
# Deliberately NOT `set -e`: this is a convenience seeder, not a hard dependency
# of the dev environment. It is invoked via `bash` in postCreateCommand (so it
# does not depend on a working-tree exec bit, which a Windows bind mount cannot
# preserve), and it always exits 0 so a transient hiccup can never abort the
# rest of postCreate (mise trust, mise install, ...).
